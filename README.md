## Pairs Game

Implement Game to play pairs, such that all cards are spread out in a grid and each player takes it in turn to turn over two cards. They make a trick if the cards have the same rank, regardless of suit. If they make a trick, they get to have another go. The winner is the player with the most tricks. No jokers are required.

## Hints

- We are not expecting any completely perfect solutions; we are far more interested in the way you write code and think about a problem.
- Please commit often when writing your solution so that we can see the order in which the solution was completed.
